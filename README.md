# Silent Errors in Express.js Async Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js Express.js applications where errors within asynchronous middleware are not properly handled, leading to silent failures. The server continues to run even when encountering errors, making debugging significantly harder.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server with an asynchronous route handler.  This handler uses `Promise.catch` to handle errors; however, this approach only logs the error to the console but does not propagate the error up to Express.js.  As a result, the server doesn't respond with an appropriate error status code or message to the client, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-trace issues.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a better approach. It uses a `try...catch` block within the asynchronous function and uses `next(err)` to propagate the error to the Express.js error handling middleware. This allows Express.js to handle the error appropriately, returning an error response to the client.  The server's error handling middleware is also improved to provide informative error responses.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd silent-express-errors`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the buggy code: `node bug.js`
5. Run the solution: `node bugSolution.js`

Observe the difference in behavior and error handling.
